# journey-so-far
My first repository, couple html, css and javascript scribbles
Little about me: i'm kind of a jack of all trades trying to master front end development. i love music, true crime movie, singing in the shower and Liverpool football club.
I am very open to learning in any form of internship, as i just began my journey as a front end developer. I am a smart,hardwoking and passionate individual who channels these attribites to anything she sets her mind to.
